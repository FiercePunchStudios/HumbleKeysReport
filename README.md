# HumbleKeysReport
A Playnite extension script that reports on the redeemed status of Humble Bundle keys as returned by FiercePunchStudios/HumbleKeysLibrary extension

## Roadmap
* It may be worth trying to determine whether a given game entry in the library is unique. What a user would do with an unredeemed game might change depending on whether they already own that game via another entry.
